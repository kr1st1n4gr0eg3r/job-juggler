# Chrome Devtools Script For Easier Job Searching

![funny hacker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kr1st1n4gr0eg3r/linkedin-hacks/main/img/giphy.webp)

This is a Chrome devtools script to help visualize your job search as well as remove any irrelevant noise from your search. This can be used on any site with the right parameters (just change the classes or ids). For example, if you only want to see posts with salaries, any posts in the div will display: none. I'll add more from other job sites as I go along. 

Useage:

1. Open Chrome
2. Open Dev Tools
3. Click on "console"
4. Paste script and hit enter

I hope this helps! Enjoy.
